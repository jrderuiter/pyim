[![Build Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/550e9fef5ab6cc1352a74bf1/badge?branchName=master)](https://app.shippable.com/projects/550e9fef5ab6cc1352a74bf1/builds/latest)

PyIM is a software package for implementing pipelines that identify transposon
integration sites from targeted DNA-sequencing of transposon insertions. The
package implements a number of standard pipelines used in our group, but also
provides the basic build blocks for custom pipelines.
